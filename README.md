# vos
This  (vos)  editor  is  intended  to edit very large files in only one line, formed by fixed positions and which are imported from  IBM  Main-frames to Linux. Since  most  of the editors in the market or in Linux distributions try to load the full file in memory, and this is  a  problem  when  working with large files, vos is the best option to cover this scene.
