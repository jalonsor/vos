# vos
(Very early stage, but functional). This  (vos) editor  is  intended  to edit very large files in only one line, formed by fixed positions and which are imported from  IBM  Main-frames to Linux. Since  most  of the editors in the market or in Linux distributions try to load the full file in memory, and this is  a  problem  when  working with large files, vos is the best option to cover this scene.  Some keys are similar to IBM ISPF.

NAME
       vos - editor

DESCRIPTION
       This (vos) editor is intended to edit very large files in only one line, formed by fixed positions and which are imported from IBM Mainframes to Linux.

       Since most of the editors in the market or in Linux distributions try to load the full file in memory, and this is a problem when working with large files,
       vos is the best option to cover this scene.

       *** IT IS VERY IMPORTANT *** that you work with a fixed window terminal size and you do not change it while running vos.

       *** IT IS VERY IMPORTANT *** that you know that CTRL+S/CTRL+Q are special combinations for your serial terminal handler. These combined keys  are  software
       flow  control signals same as XOFF/XON hardware control. If you press CTRL+S (XOFF=scroll-lock) your terminal does not refresh. Then, you must press CTRL+Q
       (XON=scroll-lock off) to restart the refresh of your terminal. If you want to inhibit these combined keys you  must  reconfigure  your  terminal  (see  man stty).

COMMAND LINE
